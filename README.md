# Endpoint Health Tracker

A C#/.NET console application built to practice core backend and systems fundamentals.

## Purpose
This project focuses on learning and applying:
- C# object-oriented fundamentals
- Data modeling and constructors
- Collections and ordering
- LINQ for filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- Basic .NET solution and project structure

## What it does
- Models a network endpoint and its health checks over time
- Stores health reports as a time-ordered list
- Uses LINQ to analyze health status and latency
- Demonstrates method and query LINQ syntax

## Why it matters
This mirrors how cloud and infrastructure teams reason about telemetry and system health at a fundamental level, without unnecessary complexity.

## Tech
- C#
- .NET (Console App)

*Learning-focused project emphasizing clarity, structure, and fundamentals.*
